## What’s Near Go? 🦒🌿

Near Go lets you **spot real-life animals** and **record them on the Ethereum blockchain** as immutable digital keepsakes. 📜✨ Simply **snap a photo of an animal**, write its record in your **NearDex**, and watch your sightings collection grow while making a **difference in wildlife conservation efforts**!

## How We Built It 🛠

🔧 **Near Go** is powered by **NEAR Protocol**, and here's a quick breakdown of the magic behind the scenes:

- **Near Rust Smart Contract** deployed to `neargoredacted.testnet` to record wildlife records 🦀🚀
- **NEAR Wallet Selector** for seamless integration with Near user wallets 💸💡
- **Pinata SDK & IPFS** to scalably and immutably store all the images captured to IPFS! 🖼️💿
- **Gemini AI** to help analyze the images you capture—making sure you’ve spotted something real! 🤖📊
- **Near-API-JS** to call all those cool blockchain functions with a snap of your fingers ⚙️✨

## Why We’re Building This 💡

**Wildlife tracking is a $2.1 billion market**, but let’s face it—it’s **expensive** and **not accessible** to the average person. We’re flipping the script by turning everyday nature lovers into **citizen scientists**! 📈👩‍🔬 Imagine walking through a park, snapping a photo of a rare butterfly, and knowing that your casual encounter helped conservation efforts. 🦋🌺

It’s not just fun and games; it’s **real-world impact**—plus, who doesn’t want to collect some adorable animal NFTs? 💖✨
